Atto Web Server
===============
Atto is a single file, low dependency, pure PHP web server and web routing engine

 * Atto can be used to route requests, and hence, serve as a micro
 framework for use under a traditional web server such as Apache, nginx,
 or lighttpd. 
 
 * Atto can be used as a stand alone web server for apps 
 created using its routing facility. 
 
 * Atto is web request event-driven, supporting
 asynchronous I/O for web traffic. 
 
 * Atto supports timers for background events.
 
 * Unlike similar PHP software, as a Web Server it instantiates traditional
 PHP superglobals like $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, $_COOKIE, $_SESSION,
 $_FILES, etc and endeavors to make it easy to code apps in a rapid PHP style.
